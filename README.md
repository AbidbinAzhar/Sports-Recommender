# Sports-Recommender
Situation: Developed a Machine Learning model as a part of my academic coursework

1. My Task was to develop a model to recommend sports categories from game data using machine learning techniques.
2. Employed pandas and scikit-learn libraries to preprocess data and implement a predictive model.
3. Utilized Decision Tree Classifier for its simplicity and interpretability.
4. Split the dataset into training and testing subsets, allocating 80% for training and 20% for testing.
5. Trained the model on the training data and fine-tuned hyperparameters as necessary.
