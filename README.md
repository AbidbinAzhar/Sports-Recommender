# Sports-Recommender
Situation: Developed a Machine Learning model as a part of my academic coursework

1. Utilized pandas and scikit-learn libraries for data manipulation and machine learning.
2. My Task was to recommend sports categories from game data using machine learning techniques.
3. Employed pandas and scikit-learn libraries to preprocess data and implement a predictive model.
4. Utilized Decision Tree Classifier for its simplicity and interpretability.
5. Split the dataset into training and testing subsets, allocating 80% for training and 20% for testing.
6. Trained the model on the training data and fine-tuned hyperparameters as necessary.
